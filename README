MUD Zone Editor

In 1994-1995, I often played a MUD called Eternal Twilight.  The implementor
of Eternal Twilight and I became friends after a friend of mine and I had
hacked into the game and given ourselves god-like powers.  Time passed and
I offered to create a new starting zone, rather than the standard ROM one
that the mud initially came with.

I had written this program so I could create new zones for this MUD and now
I had a perfect opportunity to try it out.

This was my first (and last) usage of my WOLF library to build a Windows
program.

If you had an old enough Borland C++ compiler, you might still be able to
build it.
